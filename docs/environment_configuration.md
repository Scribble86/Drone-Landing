# Configuring the Environment

Our software accepts various parameters through environment variables. They are listed here for convenience

* `MAX_FRAMES_PER_SECOND`: The fastest the software is allowed to acquire and process frames from the drone
* `HORIZONTAL_FIELD_OF_VIEW`: The horizontal field of view in degrees of the drone's camera
* `ARDUPILOT_CONNECTION`: The Ardupilot connection string

See [config.py](../precision_drone_landing/config.py).
